Hi there, I'm Sibusiso Ngubeni, a passionate fullstack and backend developer with a focus on javascript engineering. I'm excited to share my work and collaborate with like-minded developers.

üöÄ About Me
I'm a creative problem-solver who enjoys building innovative solutions to real-world challenges. My interest in fullstack and backend development stems from a deep appreciation for the power of technology and its potential to improve lives.

I'm currently honing my skills in javascript engineering, with a particular focus on Node.js and React.js. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and techniques, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge.

üíª My Work
I take pride in creating high-quality, well-designed software that is both functional and user-friendly. I'm committed to writing clean, efficient code that is easy to read and maintain.

I'm currently working on several projects, including:

BEAMit: BEAMit is an exciting new platform that aims to facilitate cross-platform communication for users and organizations. The platform's main benefit is its ability to enable users to send messages or status updates to multiple social media platforms with just one click while also serving serving content and instant messaging services as its own standalone site/app. This saves time and effort, allowing users to reach a wider audience and engage with their followers more efficiently.

As a developer, i'm in the early stages of building BEAM, currently focusing on CSS and HTML. While i'm still learning about JS, databases, and APIs, i have a clear vision for the platform's features and benefits.

One of the key features of BEAMit is its ability to send messages or status updates to multiple social media platforms according to user preference at once. This includes Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and email. By allowing users to choose their preferred platform, BEAM ensures that messages are delivered in the most convenient and effective way possible.

For organizations, BEAMit will offer a premium paid version with access to statistics. This allows organizations to target their advertising campaigns to specific interest groups, increasing their reach and engagement. To make this possible, BEAMit will incorporate learning algorithms, knowledge graphs and recommendation engines, using machine-learned user data to provide personalized recommendations and insights.

The platform's niche and target audience are yet to be identified, For example, LinkedIn is known for its focus on professional business and career content.By identifying a clear niche, BEAMit has the potential to revolutionize cross-platform communication with its innovative features and user-focused approach.



BafokengPhokeng: BafokengPhokeng is an innovative platform designed to cater specifically to the Bafokeng community, providing a comprehensive solution for the various needs of the Bafokeng community. The platform will serve as a media sharing platform for Bafokeng news, events, and social expression, allowing users to stay informed and connected with their community. It will also function as an instant messaging platform, enabling real-time communication between users.

Furthermore, BafokengPhokeng will serve as an online marketplace for small businesses and individuals to buy and sell items, as well as form business relationships to boost the Bafokeng economy. The platform will function as an escrow agent between online buyers and sellers, minimizing online fraud and building trust within the community. The platform will also provide a broadcast feature for the Royal Bafokeng Administration to communicate announcements to the Bafokeng public, ensuring that important information is spread effectively.

Currently in development, the platform is focused on creating a user-friendly interface and incorporating various features to provide value to the Bafokeng community. By identifying a clear niche and target audience, BafokengPhokeng has the potential to become a go-to platform for the Bafokeng community, providing a one-stop solution for all their needs. The platform's unique features and commitment to serving the Bafokeng community make it an exciting and promising project, with the potential to make a significant impact in the region.
